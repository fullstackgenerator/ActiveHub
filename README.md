Users can quickly register and log in, then browse a selection of membership offerings that range from flexible short-term access to extended yearly commitments, plus unique specialized programs. Once a membership is secured, the user's profile is updated to reflect their active programs and their respective end dates, keeping everything transparent and easy to track.

The administrative backend provides a powerful toolkit for managing the center's operations. Through a dedicated admin login, staff can oversee user accounts, performing necessary edits or removals. The system also offers detailed insights into the center’s performance, displaying statistics on user numbers, membership types, and revenue generation. And because data is king, all this valuable information can be conveniently exported to an Excel spreadsheet using the integrated EPPlus library, allowing for in-depth analysis.
